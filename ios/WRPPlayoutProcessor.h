// The voice chain the iOS playout device runs on every buffer WebRTC hands it:
// input gain -> soft-knee compressor -> lookahead peak limiter.
//
// Plain C with no Apple dependency on purpose: it runs on the real-time render
// thread, so it must never allocate, lock or message an object, and keeping it
// portable means it can be compiled and measured off-device.
//
// The Android half cannot run code on the playout path, so it approximates this
// chain with the platform's DynamicsProcessing effect. The numbers in
// `WRPPlayoutConfigDefault` are mirrored in `WebRtcPlaybackInstaller.kt` — change them
// together.
